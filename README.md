Scratch game converted to an HTML file and made into an electron app

### Prerequisites
Make sure that the following are installed:
- [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Converting to HTML
There are many ways to convert a `.sb3` file to an `.html` file. This [nifty tool](https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/) gets the job done quite nicely.

### Usage
Once downloaded, run the following command in the command prompt to install necessary dependencies and run the app respectively:
```bash
npm install
```

After you can either run the app with:
```bash
yarn start
```

Or build the app into an `.exe` file for windows:
```bash
yarn dist
```
